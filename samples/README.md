# Quickstart

You must have Java 8 installed on your system. Maven will be automatically
downloaded and installed by the maven wrapper `mvnw`.

Build the samples for Java 8
```sh
./mvnw clean package
```

Run the HelloEdgent sample
```sh
cd topology
./run-sample.sh HelloEdgent   # prints a hello message and terminates
  Hello
  Edgent!
  ...
```

# Overview

The Edgent samples provide a starting point for jump starting your
use of Edgent.  See the _Samples Summary_ section for a list of the samples.

The Edgent samples are organized into a few categories (subdirectories)
and are a collection of maven projects.  They can be built using maven
or other maven-integrated tooling such as Eclipse.

An Edgent application template maven project is supplied.
It may be a useful starting point to clone for your application.
The template has a standalone maven project pom, rather than a 
stylized one used by the rest of the samples. 
See [template/README.md](template/README.md).

See [APPLICATION_DEVELOPMENT.md](APPLICATION_DEVELOPMENT.md) for general
information on Edgent Application Development, Packaging and Execution.

Getting Started https://edgent.apache.org/docs/edgent-getting-started


# Setup

Once you have downloaded and unpacked the samples source bundle 
or cloned the the samples repository you need to download
these additional development software tools.

* Java 8 - The development setup assumes Java 8

Maven is used as build tool and a maven-wrapper
script (`mvwn` or `mvnw.bat`) is included.

The maven-wrapper automatically downloads and installs the
correct Maven version and use it. Besides this, there is no
difference between using the `mvnw` command and the `mvn` command. 

You may also use a maven-integrated IDE with the samples.
e.g., see the _Using Eclipse_ section below.

The samples use Edgent SDK jars that have been released
in a maven repository such as Maven Central.

Alternatively, you can download the Edgent SDK sources and build them,
populating your local maven repository.  The samples
will then use those Edgent SDK jars.  Adjust the `edgent.version` 
property in the top level samples `pom.xml` accordingly.
See [downloads](https://edgent.apache.org/docs/downloads) 
for downloading the Edgent SDK sources.

# Building the Edgent samples

By default Java8 class files are generated.
Java7 platform class files are produced when the appropriate
profile is specified.

Currently, building and running the samples for the Android platform
is not supported.  Many samples happen to use the `DevelopmentProvider`,
which is not supported on the Android platform.

Build the samples
```sh
./mvnw clean package  # -Pplatform-java7 as needed
```

A standard jar and uber jar are created for each sample category
in the sample category's target directory: `<category>/target`.


## Running the samples

See the `README.md` in each sample category directory for information
on running the samples.


# Using Eclipse

The Edgent Git repository and samples source release bundle contains 
Maven project definitions for the samples.

Once you import the Maven projects into your workspace, builds
in Eclipse use the same artifacts as the Maven command line tooling. 
Like the command line tooling, the jars for dependent projects
are automatically downloaded to the local maven repository
and used.

If you want to use Eclipse to clone your fork, use the 
Eclipse Git Team Provider plugin

1. From the Eclipse *File* menu, select *Import...*
2. From the *Git* folder, select *Projects from Git* and click *Next*
3. Select *Clone URI* to clone the remote repository. Click *Next*.
    + In the *Location* section, enter the URI of your fork in the *URI* field
      (e.g., `git@github.com:<username>/incubator-edgent.git`). 
      The other fields will be populated automatically. 
      Click *Next*. If required, enter your passphrase.
    + In the *Source Git Repository* window, select the branch 
      (usually `master`) and click *Next*
    + Specify the directory where your local clone will be stored 
      and click *Next*. The repository will be cloned. 
      Note: You can build and run tests using Maven in this directory.
4. In the *Select a wizard to use for importing projects* window, click *Cancel*.  
   Then follow the steps below to import the Maven projects.


Once you have cloned the Git repository to your machine or are working 
from an unpacked samples source release bundle, import the Maven projects
into your workspace

1. From the Eclipse *File* menu, select *Import...*
2. From the *Maven* folder, select *Existing Maven Projects* and click *Next*
  + browse to the `samples` directory in the clone or source release directory
    and select it.  A hierarchy of samples projects / pom.xml files will be
    listed and all selected. 
  + Verify the *Add project(s) to working set* checkbox is checked
  + Click *Finish*.  Eclipse starts the import process and builds the workspace.

Top-level artifacts such as `README.md` are available under the 
`edgent-samples` project.

Note: Specifics may change depending on your version of Eclipse or the 
Eclipse Maven or Git Team Provider.

Once the samples projects have been imported you can run them from
Eclipse in the usual manner. E.g.,

1. From the Eclipse *Navigate* menu, select *Open Type*
   + enter type type name `HelloEdgent` and click *OK*
2. right click on the `HelloEdgent` class name and from the context menu
   + click on *Run As*, then *Java application*.
   `HelloEdgent` runs and prints to the Console view.


# Samples Summary

<pre>
HelloEdgent          Basic mechanics of declaring a topology and executing
                     it. Prints Hello Edgent! to standard output.

                     filtering of simulated sensors that are bursty in
                     nature, so that only intermittently is the data output
                     to standard output.
                         
File                 Use the File stream connector to write a stream of
                     tuples to files. Also watch a directory for new files

# Licensing

Apache Edgent samples are released under the Apache License Version 2.0.

Apache Edgent is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF),
sponsored by the Incubator PMC. Incubation is required of all newly accepted
projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications,
and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other
successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection
of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project
has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
